### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**gumshoesbex/gumshoesbex** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

I'm a people-loving musician preparing to join the world of software development. The story goes something like this: I studied biology, and then forensic anthropology, and learned A LOT about skeletons. I spent time at the Body Farm, and went on to teach forensic science to unsuspecting schoolchildren. During that time, I learned how much I love creating stories! So I wrote a mystery novel. 

All along, I've played music and worked as a music director at a number of churches. Music, as I see it, is a way for people to learn, grow, have fun together, and connect across differences. And, as I've transitioned to software development, I'm noticing that those same things apply! And, both coding and music require attention to detail, creative thinking, and lots of repetition to improve. Iâ€™m excited to embark on this next chapter as a software developer and would love to connect.
